⁠If you are looking for a paranormal romance series with a strong female lead, we recommend that you skip The Unleashing and try Night Reigns.⁠

The Unleashing By Shelly Laurenston focuses on Nordics myths, specifically on the Crows, a group of female warriors, and their counterpart the Ravens, a group of male warriors. Kera, the MC gets turned into a Crow after she is killed, and when she goes to live with them, we expected to meet a group of badass women. Instead, the Crows embody every offensive stereotype about women, and we had to double check to see if this book was written by a man. Her love interest is a Raven, but there is very little romance in this book. So many characters and POVs are introduced, and it gets very confusing. We almost stopped reading this one, and we recommend that you don't start.⁠

Night Reigns by Dianne Duvall is the exact opposite. It is one of our favorites in the Immortal Guardians series and starts with Ami rescuing Marcus, an Immortal Guardian who is resistant to help of any kind. There is plenty of romance, and Ami is fierce and independent while still showing her vulnerable side.⁠ There is also a big reveal at the end!

🎧 for sure. Kirsten Potter narrates all of the Immortal Guardians books, and does an amazing job bring the characters and the story to life.⁠
