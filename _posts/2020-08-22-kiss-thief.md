We thought we knew what we were getting with The Kiss Thief by LJ Shen, but we could not have been more wrong.
<br>
<br>
We've read all of the Sinners of Saint series and the All Saints High series, so we're pretty familiar with LJ Shen's style. We saw that The Kiss Thief was on a bunch of romance lists, including nominated for the best romance of the year on Goodreads in 2019 (🤯). So we thought we'd try it... 🤦‍♀️⁠
<br>
<br>
The Kiss Thief is about a super sheltered mafia princess(?? what is that? that's not a thing!) who gets into an arranged marriage with a senator who is an enemy of her family. He's much older than her and supposed to be a dark, brooding, but redeemable bad-boy. But he's not redeemable. He takes her virginity without her consent. He's horrible to her throughout. She's a beautiful, rich princess with no interesting personality traits (but still deserves better!)⁠
<br>
<br>
**TW**: sexual abuse/non-consent and violence⁠
<br>
<br>
So, we'd recommend ANY OTHER LJ Shen book over this one. But we decided to list our favorite, although we don't _love_ any of her books. The only one that rises slightly above the rest is Broken Knight. ⁠
<br>
<br>
We like Broken Knight more than the others because the characters have genuine problems and are an interesting/unlikely pairing. Knight has a dying mother and Luna was abandoned by hers as a baby. They are opposites in most ways: he's outgoing and popular, she's mute and nerdy. Yet, they are best friends who love each other deeply but are afraid to take the next step in their relationship out of fear of losing/hurting each other. They help each other through their darkest times and learn to forgive mistakes. This is technically "new adult" but the themes and issues are very adult, so we don't think of it that way

⚡📖 or 🎧⚡: ⁠

🤷‍♀️ We liked the audiobook but didn't LOVE it. It's told from two perspectives so there is a male and female narrator, which we like. ⁠
