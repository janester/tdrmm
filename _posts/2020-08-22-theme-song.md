‚Å†What song best describes your reading style? Ours is pretty obviously "That Don't Impress Me Much" by Shania Twain!‚Å†

We want to thank @iamsarahdooley for recording our theme song for us! We love it! If y'all love music and/or comedy, we highly recommend checking her out. She never talks about books, but we love her anyway üòú.‚Å†

One day we'll get around to using this for it's intended purpose: an opening theme to a booktube channel. But for now, we'll just admire it from our grid.
